    <div class= "ADOPT">
        <p> ADOPT! The best way to help is to take one  of these furry friends home. Providing our pets  with best and most loving homes has always been our goal and we believe that adoption is the best way to do this! </p>

    <div class= "DONATE">
        <p> DONATE! Adopting a pet comes with a lot of responsibilites and we understand that not everyone can accomodate a pet in their life. If you can’t adopt please consider donating  so that we can provide our pets with the best care until they find their forever homes! </p>

    <div class= "PICME">
        <p> PICME! Can’t adopt or donate? No problem! You can still help us by posting a picture of  one of our adoptees on social media with #PICME. Help spread the word! </p>
