        <p>ADOPT! The best way to help is to take one of these furry friends home. Providing our pets with best and most loving homes has always been our goal and we believe that adoption is the best way to do this!</p>

      <div class="item donate"> 
        <p>DONATE! Adopting a pet comes with a lot of responsibilities and we understand that not everyone can accommodate a pet in their life. If you can’t adopt please consider donating so that we can provide our pets with the best care until they find their forever homes!</p>
